We are generating Configuration by multiplying dictionaries to get all possible Combinations

```Python
def generate_combinations(configurations):
	values = [list(config[1].keys()) for config in configurations]
	return list(itertools.product(*values))
```

Configurations are dicts like:
```Python
Models = {
	1: "02", # Cabrio
	2: "03", # Targa
	3: "04", # Turbo
	0: "01", # Coupe
}

HexUnilack = { #Color
	"#FCFCFC": "U02",
	"#CFC7B5": "U03",
	"#18253C": "U04",
	"#253E8F": "U05",
	"#096899": "U06",
	...
}

Decals = {
	0: "01", # Carrera
	1: "02", # Porsche Line
}

Kennzeichen = {
	0: "00", # Ohne
	1: "01", # Deutschland
	2: "02", # Ã–sterreich
	3: "03", # Schweiz
}
```

When generating Combinations we create tuples like this:
```
###################### Combinations for DecalsBase ######################
Fahrwerk, Bodykits, BGColor, DecalCol, DecalType, Kennzeichen
(1, 1, (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0), 0, 0, 1)
(2, 2, (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0), 0, 1, 2)
(1, 3, (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 1.0), 1, 1, 3)
```

When rendering we iterate over these tuples. Set all parts accordingly and take a picture for each Camera
## Considerations
- Cameras could be considered to be a part of configurations as well
- Light setups could be considered to be a part of configurations
- Glass setups could be considered to be part of configurations
- exceptions should be made if we don't want specific combinations
